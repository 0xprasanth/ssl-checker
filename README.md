# SSL Certificate Checker

## Overview

This project is a backend service that checks the SSL certificate of a given domain. It is built using Rust with the Actix-web framework, offering efficient, safe, and concurrent execution. The primary functionality involves fetching SSL certificates and extracting important certificate data such as issuer, subject, expiration date, and domain validation.

## Technology Choices
- **Next.js**: While not part of this specific backend, Next.js would complement the backend service with its full-stack capabilities, providing a robust front-end experience with static generation, server-side rendering (SSR), and API routes integration.

- **Rust**: Rust was chosen for its strong memory safety guarantees and performance benefits. Rustâ€™s type system and ownership model eliminate many common bugs (e.g., null pointer dereferencing, data races), which makes it a great choice for building reliable and high-performance network services like SSL certificate checkers.
  


### Key Libraries(frontend):

### Key Libraries(backend):
- **Actix-Web**: Chosen for its high-performance, non-blocking capabilities in building Rust web applications.
- **Rustls & Webpki**: These libraries are used for managing SSL/TLS connections securely and validating certificate chains.
- **X509-parser**: This helps in parsing and extracting information from X.509 certificates.

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

1. **Self-Signed Certificates**: The service currently identifies self-signed certificates, which can be flagged in the response.
2. **Revocation Status**: The revocation check (e.g., OCSP or CRL) is not yet implemented. It is assumed that most users are interested in the certificate validity period and domain verification.
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling has been implemented for cases such as invalid domain names or failed TLS connections. More detailed error responses could be provided.
4. **Client Config**: The client config is pre-loaded with default root certificates, which can be extended in the future to support additional or custom certificate authorities (CAs).

## Known Limitations and Areas for Improvement

- **Domain Validation**: While the code checks for domain validity using the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension, there are edge cases with wildcards and IP addresses that aren't fully handled.
  
- **Error Messaging**: The error messages returned to the client are quite minimal. They could be more descriptive to help clients understand the exact nature of the issue (e.g., connection timeout vs invalid certificate).
  
- **Performance**: As this project scales, performance could be optimized further by handling multiple domain requests concurrently and caching certificate results where applicable.
- **Rate Limiting**: A rate limiting mechanism is implemented to avoid abuse of the SSL checker API. This ensures that clients are restricted to a set number of requests per minute or hour to protect the server from being overwhelmed.
