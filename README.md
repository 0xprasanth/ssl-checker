# SSL Certificate Checker

## Overview

This is a full-stack project using Nextjs as frontend  and built using Rust with the Actix-web framework, offering efficient, safe, and concurrent execution. The primary functionality involves fetching SSL certificates and extracting important certificate data such as issuer, subject, expiration date, and domain validation.

## Technology Choices
- **Next.js**: The frontend of the application is built using Next.js and provides a single-page application (SPA) with server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, allowing users to easily interact with the application.

- **Rust**: Rust was chosen for its strong memory safety guarantees and performance benefits. Rustâ€™s type system and ownership model eliminate many common bugs (e.g., null pointer dereferencing, data races), which makes it a great choice for building reliable and high-performance network services like SSL certificate checkers.
  


### Key Libraries(frontend):
- **TanStack Query** is a Powerful asynchronous state management for TS/JS, React, Solid, Vue, Svelte and Angular. It gives hooks for fetching, caching and updating asynchronous data in React
- **Axios** is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.
- **Lucide React:** Icon library for React applications.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- **Shadcn UI Library**: It is collection of UI re-components and offers ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

### Key Libraries(backend):
- **Actix-Web**: Chosen for its high-performance, non-blocking capabilities in building Rust web applications.
- **Rustls & Webpki**: These libraries are used for managing SSL/TLS connections securely and validating certificate chains.
- **X509-parser**: This helps in parsing and extracting information from X.509 certificates.

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

1. **Domain Validation**: The application assumes that users will input domain names in various formats (with or without 'https://', 'www', etc.). The frontend includes logic to clean and validate these inputs.
2. **Revocation Status**: The revocation check (e.g., OCSP or CRL) is not yet implemented. It is assumed that most users are interested in the certificate validity period and domain verification.
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling has been implemented for cases such as invalid domain names or failed TLS connections. More detailed error responses could be provided.
4. **UI Design**: A clean, responsive design was chosen to ensure good user experience across different devices. 


## Known Limitations and Areas for Improvement

- **Domain Validation**: While the code checks for domain validity using the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension, there are edge cases with wildcards and IP addresses that aren't fully handled.
- **CRL/OCSP Check**: need to implement to track invalid certificates and monitor certificate revocation occurrences.
- **Rate Limiting**: A rate limiting mechanism is implemented to avoid abuse of the SSL checker API. This ensures that clients are restricted to a set number of requests per minute or hour to protect the server from being overwhelmed.
- **View Past Certificate Checks** Add user authentication for tracking personal SSL certificate checks.
- **Client-Side Hydration** Due to Nextjs's server-side rendering capabilities, when ever the previous request failed then the next request doesn't hydrate to client-side and requires couple of refresh to hydrate the client component

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** (for the frontend).
- **Rust** (for the backend).

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xprasanth/ssl-checker.git
   cd ssl-checker
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. **Setup Environmental variables**:
    
    Refer `.env.example` for more info

    create `.env` file and add the following
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=
   NEXT_BACKEND_API=
   ```

4. **Run the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cargo build
   ```

6. **Run the backend**:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```


## Testing with Thunder Client (Routes Info)

The SSL Certificate Checker provides a single API endpoint for checking SSL certificates. Here are the details for testing this endpoint:

### API Endpoint

- **Route**: `/ssl`
- **Method**: POST
- **URL**: `http://localhost:800/ssl` (replace `localhost` with your server's IP if hosted elsewhere)

### Request Body

The request body should be in JSON format with a single field:

```json
{
  "domain": "google.com"
}
```

Replace `google.com` with the domain you want to check.

### Response Example

A successful response will return a JSON object containing details about the SSL certificate:

```json
{
  "validity": true,
  "expiration_date": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 02:46:04 +0000",
  "issuer": "C=US, O=Google Trust Services, CN=WR2",
  "subject": "CN=*.google.com",
  "is_valid_for_domain": true,
  "ca_valid": false,
  "self_signed": false,
  "revocation_status": "Not implemented"
}
```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser (by default, at `http://localhost:3000`).
2. Enter a domain name into the input field.
3. Click the **Submit** button to initiate the SSL certificate check.
4. View the results section for details on the SSL certificate validation.

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Rust, HTTPS libraries for certificate validation.
